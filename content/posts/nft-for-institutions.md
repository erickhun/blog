Today's biggest miscconcepions about NFTs is that they're simple jpeg image. Some think NFT isnt't like a baseball card. It's not. 


## What NFT isn't

NFT isn't like 

NFT is a proof of ownernership that one own something. Why is that proof of ownership actually ? This is where .
But isn't the original in the. he simply put a copy of it . Some might argue that the original is store on the harddrive. Copying it on the blockcchain wouldn't be the original isn't it? 


Ig you create an NFT. It's up to the . Today it has not any legal value. But what if tomorrow it has, and government start utilising it as a proof of ownership? In today's society, you can use the receipt for the sale to prove you own something, a computer, car, and even a house. 



I believe it's somehow more appealing because visual, but the use case is more used as a proof that you own something.  

But what if I tell you that we could use NFTs for some more "serious" or "concrete" use cases, such as governments records? I'll take that "NFT bubble" opportunity to give a more practical use case : **Recording ownership of real estates in a city**. 

A really interesting discussions with [a friend](https://twitter.com/guillaumecherea) was about _cadastral maps_. They're basically a map of a city telling who owns the property and how big it is. Cadestral maps exist since 18th century BCE, this is more than 4000 years!

In most European countries, each time a transaction happens on a real estate, or if the property is modified (become bigger or smaller), you are required to update that map. This is done at the  city hall. But in most case, you can't do it yourself, and have to go through a notary that is allowed do that, and will charge you thousands of dollars to update your name or the size of your home. 



When you buy an NFT you're not even buying the GIF, you're buying the receipt proving you bought the GIF.

javais un appareil quand jetais ado. Mais j'avais une tige en metal (permanent retainers?) coller a mes dent, mais  qui partait petit a petit, et j'avais pas vraiment fait gaff - du coup une dent commencais a partir en cacahuete. 
Je suis aller voir un dentiste et ma conseiller de refaire un appareil, mais  j'ai opete un invisalign. Par contre le traitement requiere de  creer de "l'espace" avec l'IPR - c'est vraiment pas marrant , c'est vraiment comme aller a massacre a la tronconeuse tous les mois.  Et le traitement coute 6000euros. don't prenez soins de vos dents si vous voulez pas que vos profits AVAX passent dans ce genre de trucs
