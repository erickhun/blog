There is something special about Taiwan I couldn't really explain the first time I arrived. On my first trip to Taiwan, I couldn't put words to this **positive feeling** I had when roaming around the city. It was a mix of relaxation, freedom, safety, friendliness, and convenience, everything all at once. I didn't do much; I walked randomly in the city, worked in coffee shops, ate in random restaurants. I only stayed a week, but I knew I'd come again for a longer stay. That feeling stuck with me for a while, and I decided to leave Beijing for Taipei, to get a sense of whether that was a temporary feeling or if there was something more.

Fast forward, I stayed long enough - to get my permanent residence (APRC)[^3] - to put words to this feeling I enjoy so much: **my alertness overhead is nonexistent when I am in Taiwan**. Every day is literally a pleasure to wake up, put on my flip-flops, and head outside:

- I can walk to the nearest convenience store or coffee shop located **within a 5-minute walk**[^1] from anywhere I live.
- I don't even need to change my pajamas or check what I look like in the mirror; people on the street don't care.
- The convenience store clerk will greet you and **go above and beyond to help you** with anything you'd need[^2].
- In the street, I can pick [any shared bike](/posts/taiwan-youbike-bike-sharing/) that will be amazingly maintained and available within a 5-minute walk from anywhere, for a ridiculous fee.
- I can have a 15-minute (sometimes 1-hour+) break outside a coffee shop with my laptop, without worrying someone will take it, with my wallet next to it!
- I can go out at 3 am in dark alleys without worrying about strangers approaching me and being threaten
- I can forget my sunglasses outside a school and find them back 2 weeks later:

Went back to check 2 weeks later, with a really little hope to see them (14 days, they&#39;re kids, of course someone will take them). But you know it&#39;s Taiwan... And dang, they were there!

This summer, I spent 3 months in Europe this year: France, Switzerland, Portugal. I had an amazing time, but something kept bothering me: **I worried too much** about silly things:

- I needed to check attentively my bags and phones when around people.
- In the news, I keep seeing stories about people being aggressed, murdered, or any kind of violence.
- I had to "dress up" to be normal and not feel judged by others.
- Friends reminded me not to put my wallet or phone on the table.
- People stared down at other people for no reason and made them uneasy.

Those small things made me increase my vigilance level. I had to stay "alert," and it just made me feel more comfortable to stay at home than outside. This **continuous level of alertness** adds a **mental overhead** that stays. Maybe are used to used to it, but I guess that's something I'm not used to anymore and make me unfomfortable when thinking about it. 

How Taiwan ended up like that could be an interesting topic. If I had to make a quick guess, I'd say that after the ROC (Taiwan) government retreated to Taiwan, Taiwanese didn't have to endure the same [reforms that happened in China since 1950](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform) and followed the democracy path. The influence of the [Japanese colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_under_Japanese_rule) for 50 years might have played a big role in the current taiwanese culture and education. How kind, thoughtful, considerate interactions are with taiwanese feels a lot japanese than chinese.

[^2]: Convenience stores are places where you can buy food, do groceries, pick up concert tickets, send a package, top up  mobile contract, pay bills & get a bubble tea or hot latte, all in the same shop.

[^3]: _Taiwan APRC_: A permanent residence permit that allows you to stay and work indefinitely in Taiwan. This permit almost _never expires_, as far as you visit Taiwan one day every 5 years. You can get it after [3 years working in Taiwan](https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/tags/aprc/).
