There is something special about Taiwan I couldn't really explain the first time I arrive. On my first trip in Taiwan,  I couldn't put words this __positive feeling__ I had when roaming around the city. It was a mix of relaxation, freedom, safety, friendliness, and convenience, everything all at once. I didn't do much, walked randomly in the city, worked in coffee shops, ate in random restaurants. I only stayed a week, but I knew I'll come again for a longer stay. That feeling sticked with me for a while and I decided to leave Beijing for Taipei, to get a sense if that was a temporary feeling or if there was something more. 

Fast forward, I stayed long enough - to get my permanent residence (APRC)[^3] - but especially to put words on this feeling I enjoy so much: **my alertness overhead is non-existent when I am in Taiwan**. Everyday is literally a pleasure to wake up, put on my flip-flop and head outside: 
- I walk the nearest convenience store or coffee shops located  __less than 5 minutes walk__[^1] from anywhere I live
- I don't even need to change my pajamas or check what I look like on the mirror, people in the street don't care 
- The convenience store clerk will great you, and __go above and beyond to help you__ for anything you'd need[^2].
- In the street, I can pick [any shared bike](/posts/taiwan-youbike-bike-sharing/) that will be amazingly maintained, and available in less than 5 minutes walk from anywhere, for a ridicous fee. 
- I can have a 15 minutes (sometimes 1hour+) break outside a coffee shop with my laptop, without worrying someone take it, with my wallet next to it!
- I can go out at 3am in dark alleys, without worrying about stranger heading toward me
- I can forget my sunglasses at the outdoor of a school, and find it back 2 weeks later:

Went back to check 2 weeks later, with a really little hope to see them (14 days, they&#39;re kids, of course someone will take them). But you know it&#39;s Taiwan... And dang, they were there!

This summer, I spent 3 months in Europe this year: France, Switzerland, Portugal. I had an amazing time, but something kept bothering me: __I worried too much__ about silly things:
- I needed to check attentively my bags and phones when around people. 
- In the news I keep seeing stories about people being aggressed, murdered or any kind of violence.
- I had to "dress up" to be normal and not feeling judged by others
- Friends reminds me to not put my wallet or phone on the table
- People stared down to other people for no reason and make them unease

Those small things made me increased my vigilance level. I had to stay "alert" and it  just made me feel more comfortable at home that outside.  This __continuous level of alertness__ is a __mental overhead__ made things a bit more unpleasant

Some might think other countries in Asia had the same feelings, but I'd argue that not:
- Korea and Japan:  People care a lot about what they look and put an enormous effort on their appearance
- Southeast asia countries - still have some safety issues

Why Taiwan ended up might be an interesting topic. If I took a guess, Taiwan having chinese roots, it however didn't have to endure all the reforms that happened in China after 1950. The Japanese colonization influence might have played its part too.

[^2]: Convenience stores are places where you can buy food, do groceries, pick up concert tickets, send a package, top up  mobile contract, pay bills & get a bubble tea or hot latte, all in the same shop.

[^3]: _Taiwan APRC_: A permanent residence permit that allows you to stay and work indefinitely in Taiwan. This permit almost _never expires_, as far as you visit Taiwan one day every 5 years. You can get it after [3 years working in Taiwan](https://goldcard.nat.gov.tw/en/tags/aprc/).
