+++

 I've spent a trendemous amount of time investigating on how to invest effectively from Taiwan. Many expats asked me the questions, so I've decided to write down how do I do it. I'll also write different options you could explore. This article **will likely apply to non-US citizen**.  I'm also not a financial advisor, and invite you to make more research. My recommendation could also not fit you. Please seek profesional advices.

## Make sure to have an emergency fund before starting

Do you have enough in your bank account for the next 6 months? This is one of the best recommendations. The goal of it is to never touch your investment until the next 15 or 20 years. The emergency fund will help you to give you enough buffer, in case you lose your job, have a bad accident. Withdrawing funds can take time, and also **will hurt the performance of your investment**.

I personally have my emergency fund in Revolut and Taipei Fubon Bank:

- **Revolut**: I'm often abroad and the flexibilty that give you Revolut in any country is great. 
- **Taipei Fubon Bank**: I want keep a single bank, Taipei Fubon Bank is known for being the cheapest to send money abroad (I'll touch on this why this is important below )

The downside of both is that you won't get much interest on them. Revolut doesn't have any interest, and Taiwan Fubon Bank rate are quite low (0.05%/week). Those aren't really profitable, but the goal is to have access to cash at time you won't expect, and it will help you and won't hurt your investment. Some western countries might also give you some better interest rates accounts, but check below if that suits you.

## Which financial security to buy?
 I'll only focus here on a long term vision investment for the next 15 to 20 years. If you're looking for short term returns, this isn't post won't be for you.

When buying a [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)) for the long term, you'll need to consider:

 - Being diversified
 - Have **really low fees**
 - understand the **tax consequences** of owning them in Taiwan
 
I personally recommend [**IWDA**](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251882/ishares-msci-world-ucits-etf-acc-fund) and  [**EIMI**](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/264659/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-imi-ucits-etf) ETFs. Let me explain

#### Diversification
On the long term, putting all your saving in a single company is risky. What if this company never grows, or worst goes bankrupt? This is called *"put all your eggs in the same basket"*. There is some financial securities that help you to diversify. They're called [ETFs](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/indexinvesting/article-4596628/Does-matter-global-ETF-invest-in.html). It's like a group of share of multiple companies grouped in a single share. By purchasing a single share of an ETF, it's like if you own a part of few to up to thousands companies, potentially in many countries.

[**IWDA**](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251882/ishares-msci-world-ucits-etf-acc-fund) is one of them. It has exposure to all developped countries (US, France, Japan, UK, Canada, etc...) and more than 1600 companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, in every sectors (tech, healthcare, finance, consumers...), and in the most developped countries. We call this called a [market exposure](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketexposure.asp).  

However, IWDA doesn't have exposure to countries like Taiwan, South Korea, China. They are called emergent markets. Having lived few years in China, and how vital are the high-end Taiwanese companies, I wanted to have exposure to those contries. [**EIMI**](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/264659/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-imi-ucits-etf) is the perfect one for that.

**Why so many countries and companies?** The reason is simple... how do you know which country or company will perform better than the other? By investing in those 2 ETFs, you'll basically tap into the world's ability to grow. You will invest into the world's biggest companies by purchasing a single share of it. 

<!-- Even during , the ecoomy in the next years might be slower than the previous year. So you shouldn't expect high returns each year, and be prepared to also see some years with negative returns.

Even though , I still own some single stocks. They represent a really small part of my portfolio and I've mostly said "bye" to that money when I clicked "buy", enven though I hope they'll grow more than the ETFs. For them, I'm aware of them  -->


<!-- #### Reinvesting the dividends
IWDA also ticks the box. The difference of reinvesting and not reinvesting the dividends can determine if your investment will be exponential or not. 

- Accumulative vs Distributive. I like , so I don't need to think about re-investing the dividends back. The funds takes care of it for me. Also, you won't be able, until you have a full share. so you might miss some potential gains.  Please not that When the fund reinvest the dividends for you, it will hit the level 1 tax and the brokers fee.
- Index funds 


### How about Crypto-currencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum?

## Which broker should I chose?

[**Interactive Brokers**](http://interactivebrokers.com/) (I'll call it IB) is the one I **highly recommend**. You'll access to all type of securities: ETFs, stocks and even currencies. It has the lowest fees to purchase them. It will also  allow you to access to the ETFs I've recommended earlier: IWDA and EIMI.

The signup process is straight forward. Simply fill your informations in the signup page, and wait few days before validation. Make sure to fill your tax residence since it will could impact how tax could be taken directly by the broker. Also, [*be aware of the monthly fee if your orders don't generate at least USD 10 of fees per month*](https://www1.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=4969).

**How about local banks?**  Local banks will charge you crazy fees to access to foreign securities, but could probably be a good pick if you want to invest in taiwanese securities. I won't expand on this since I didn't dig into this yet. 

**Make sure to change to tier pricing instead of fix**. By default, the fixed pricing is set in your IB acocunt. It only makes sense if your orders are over USD 8,000 (~228k TWD). If below that amount, you to switch to the tier pricing. I've saved hundred of USD by doing this one click change.

**How to send money to Interactive Brokers from Taiwan?** To be able to purchase financial products, you'll need to fund your IB account with real money. IB will provide you information of a bank account located in the US (Citibank) to send your money. Follow carefully the instructions. From a local Taiwanese bank account, Taiwan Fubon Bank is the bank having the reputation to have the lowest fees to send money abroad. If you want to stick with your own bank, it is totally ok. Simply shows up to your bank, and ask an employee to help you fill the document with the correct information. Protip: With Fubon, Ask to also link the Interactive Brokers account, so you could do  the wire transfer online without coming to the bank again. 

**Can I send NTD/TWD to Interactive Brokers?** No, you'll need to convert first your NTD to [USD, EUR, HKD, etc...](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=3185#:~:text=For%20each%20IB%20account%2C%20you,%2C%20SEK%2C%20SGD%20or%20USD.), and then do the transfer. It should be doable from any taiwanese banks. I personally keep all my money in USD or EURO, so I can avoid any currency  exchange fees. 

**Is there a way to send money from Taiwan to Interactive Broker for free?** There is no straightforward way to send money from Taiwan to Interactive Brokers, but here some tips: 
- Taipei Fubon Bank was the cheapest way I've found to fund the IB account located in the US that is accesible to the most people in Taiwan.
- However, since IB use Citibank, you could take advantage of the ["Global Transfer"](https://www.citibank.com.tw/sim/en/globalbanking/citizen.htm). On the website: "Foreigners and the people with Citi company account can't apply for Citibank Global transfer service." I wasn't sucessful at getting the Citibank free transfer option, even with a 3 years ARC. I however heard foreigners friends that already has a Citibank abroad could get that feature. 
- If you're from Europe,  a hacky way would be to get your money in [N26](https://n26.com/), and "withdraw" your money in Interactive brokers for free. 

## Tax in Taiwan

#### Tax on capital gain
The great benefit of Taiwan when investing that there is no capital gain. It means if you buy a stock that cost USD10 and sell it when it worth 100USD you won't pay tax on the USD 90 profit.

However, be careful, your brokers could  some fees when you sell. I've heard some brokers that could take up to 5% on the gains. It's why it's important to pick a broker. 

#### Tax on dividends
What is important to understand when calculating tax on dividends, is that it exists multiple levels of taxation: 

- **L1TW**: Percentage of tax withholding by a security's home country on dividends distributed by that security to the fund (Level 1).
- **L2TW**: Percentage of tax withholding by the country where the fund is domiciled on the dividends distributed to the investor by the fund (Level 2).
- **L3T**: Percentage of taxation that the individual investor needs to pay in their home country (Level 3).

When investing in an world ETF composed mainly of US stocks, the fund domicile is important, especially if there is no treaty between your tax residence and the fund domicile. The US tax 30% flat on them. The trick here is to go through an Irish Fund. Luckily, IWDA is located in Ireland, so you can benefit from this tax treaty. Since IWDA is composed of 60% of US companies , there is a bit of math to do to exactly know how much tax will be taken . 

When you friends say there is no tax on foreign income in Taiwan, they're talking on the **L3T** level. And this is applicable only if you're resident (living more than 183 days in Taiwan), otherwise you'll get a 21% flat on [those oversea dividends](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-taiwanhighlights-2020.pdf). So be aware to stay at least 183 days in Taiwan to enjoy this benefit :)



If we purchased directly stocks from the US, dividends will be taxed 30% flat. This is because there is no tax treaty between Taiwan and the US. 

Calculating the tax on the dividends for a given ETF is a bit tricky. Since an ETF contains share of many companies from different countried, you'll need to understand the composition of your ETF.  Since there is a treaty between the US and Ireland, and most companies being in the ETF are located in the US, the tax on the dividends are in average ~12%.


I had [to dig a bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ewl5e8/is_it_possible_to_know_how_much_dividends_an/fg3aei4/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) into how much yield the IWDA has, at the end of 2019, it is 1.0685/63.03 1.7% dividend yield.

### Tax on crypto-currencies
This is something that is still in discussion and I didn't have time to investigate in. If you have more information, feel free to reach me.

### How to fill your tax?
Simply shows up to the [tax office](https://goo.gl/maps/xReNBAMxigRMamSE6) during the tax season and declare your gain. You can easily generate a statement in Interactive brokers as a proof.
