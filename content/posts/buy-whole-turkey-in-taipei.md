It is Thanksgiving, or Christmas, and you are looking to cook a turkey in Taipei for your group of friends. You came at the right place! 

Note: In 2022, turkeys were in short supply because of a [bird flu outbreak that happen in the US](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/10/26/avian-flu-turkey-prices-holidays/). Your best chance is probably to contact one of the farm in Chiayi I've listed below.

## From a farm (online)

Chiayi is home of the turkey rice (jirou fan). Many local farms can sell you from thei online shops or Line. I've listed a couple ones I've contacted: 

### Taiwan Turkey Store Food

- Shop: https://twturkey.com/ 
- Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/taiwanturkey

1900TWD + 200TWD delivery for 8kg (17lbs). They will send you the frozen turkey. 

### Idol turkey
- Shop: https://shopee.tw/idol0402 

2000TWD for a ~10kg bird

### Turkey Chef (火雞總舖)
- Shop: https://shopee.tw/turkey_chef
- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TurkeyChef/

They have quite big turkey, 13kg (28lbs) at least. It was too big for my oven

## Thomas meat (in Taipei)

- Shop: https://www.thomasmeat.com.tw/ 
- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thomasmeat

You should pre-order them. They didn't have turkey in 2022. 

## Costco
I usually get my turkey at Costco. They usually have the [Frozen, pre-brine,  Butterballs Turkeys](https://www.butterball.com/products/whole-turkey/frozen) , and appear around mid-october to December at any Costco location in Taiwan. They weight about 7kg (16lbs) and are imported from the US. 

2022 was a special year and turkeys from the US were not imported because of the flu.

You will need to have a Costco membership (costs [1350TWD/year](https://www.costco.com.tw/membership)). 


## Dimensions of a turkey by weight - Will the turkey fits inside my oven? 
If you are really lucky, your apartment in Taiwan will come with an oven integrated in the kitchen. 
And here come the question... will the turkey will fit in your oven? 
Turkeys vary in size and all the same, here some dimensions I found I hope will help you:

- 4kg – 22cm (w) x 30cm (L) x 15cm (h) 

- 7.4kg - 27cm (w) x 35cm (L) x 19 cm (h) 
- 7.5kg - 26cm (w) x 33cm (L) x 17cm (h)

- 10kg - 32cm (w) x 39cm (L) x 19cm (h)
- 10kg – 31cm (w) x 38cm (L) x 20cm (h) 

- 12.5kg - 30cm (w) x 41cm (L) x 20cm (h)   

- 13kg - 30cm (w) x 43cm (L) x 20cm (h)
- 13kg – 33cm (w) x 39cm (L) x 20cm (h)

If you are not lucky to have a big enough oven, it exists some really big portable oven like [this one from yamazaki](https://shop.yamasakitw.com/products/sk-5680m) but might be really expensive (maybe 25,000TWD). An other alternative is to book a cooking class that have those integrated ovens for a few hours and host your party there.
