I've been traveling consistently this past 5 years. Many people ask me how I keep working out while moving between countries that often. I'll try to explain here what I think helped me to keep that consistency. 

For a bit of background, I've always  enjoyed playing volleyball since middle school, and try to go at least once a week, in any contry I visited. It was already a **habit** I had since I was younger and I believe it helped me a lot. 3 years ago, I've started to incorporate weight lifting excercices ([5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/)) in my habits, for at least 3 times a week and try the best I can to play volleyball once a week. And this **anywhere I go**.

## üèãüå≥ How to find a gym, a park, or teamates anywhere in the world? 

The biggest challenge during the 2 years of weightlifting was to find a gym with free weights and barbells. Most of the gym will only have Smith Machine Squat what's not great. I had to find a gym and either pay for a day/week/a month pass. Those kind of short term memberships are however A LOT more expensive than taking a yearly membership. But there is often some "cheap" gyms in some countries such as: 

- Taiwan has [many public gyms](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Taipei+Sports+Center/@25.0474364,121.5280767,13.47z), where you pay by the hour: usd 1,50/hour !
- Tokyo has some public gyms you can access for about usd4/day, there are the [Shibuya](https://goo.gl/maps/E8nfcuSNizjCuoB7A), [Shinjuku](https://goo.gl/maps/b1QKRc3KC3EwGxAA6) or [Minato](https://goo.gl/maps/1XUz1EbPADeJ8mGz5) ones
- Warsaw, Prague and Budapest have many gyms with monthly pass with no contract for about usd25/month
- Hotels sometimes has a gym, but I was always disapointed with the equipments there. [Some exceptions exists](hoteladeline.com) though
- If you're staying at least a month in a city, you can also ask. My strategy here is using the "free trial" of the nearest gym. At the end of the session, I ask if that's possible to arrange something for your case. Sometimes a flight ticket is enough to "stop" a yearly membership
- If you've opted out for a body weight excercices, park or your home are great and free üå≥üå≥

I've ended up switching few months ago to body weights exercices. One of the advantage (not the reason why I've switched) is that you'll only need your body weight (or a bar or elastic bands) to perform the exercices. But if that's possible, I'd still go the gym, it just became an option instead of an must have: it's always great to have additional equipments available and I still squat and deadlift when possible. And not seeing people around me working hard motivates me quite a bit!

For volleyball/beach volleyball, [Meetup](https://meetup.com) was alaways great ressource to find a group of folks to play with. What I really like is that there is most of the time an awesome vibes, no matter the country/city I go. And practising **a sport team is a great way to make new friends**!
You will however to plan a week or two in advance because each city has different rules, and you'll probaly have to adapt your schedule with the time of the meetup. 

## üìà A program that works for you, and keep you going anywhere you go
I highly recommend to anyone going to the gym, travelers or not, to follow a program and **keep tracking of their progress**. I believe going to the gym without is not doing the most of your time in the gym. Assuming the reasons to go to the gym are either to build muscle or to get more fit, the best way to achieve that is to make progress. For example by lifting heavier, running faster, holding holder etc...

No matter what program you follow, **pick one program that fits you and work for you**. I like the [5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) program because it is simple and easy to follow with the app, and you just need a squat rack (usually not use at the gym ü§î). I don't like to think much about when doing hard exercices (might be because of the blood going more to the muscle instead of the brain ü§™) so this program was perfect for me. I also highly recommend 5x5 to everyone asking for a program, I strongly believe [squats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs_Ej32IYgo) and [deadlift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYREQkVtvEc&t=18) are must excercices to incorporate into have in any program you follow for a solid base and back (and you [don't want to have that chicken leg syndrom aren't you üòú](https://www.eatliver.com/leg-day/)?). 

Clearly seeing progress helped me to keep going, and pushed me to achieve better results. I didn't want to see those results vanish, it's why **I was doing everything to find a gym no matter what**. It sounds like an infinite loop, but that's a something I'm glad I I understand about myself. **Seeing progress is the main reason that keeps me motivated to go to the gym**. Here are my progress for the 5x5 (blue line is the [squat exercice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs_Ej32IYgo), and green line the [deadlift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYREQkVtvEc&t=18)):

On the chart, it looked like I've reached my limit, and it was a bit disapointed for me to see this. I know this is a beginner program, but I was happy with the "gainz" I was getting, so I just kept going. Maybe I needed to eat more? Switch to an other more advanced lifting program (5/3/1)? Probably. Buy a belt? I don't know. 

I just **started to feel bored did not feel that excited about the exercices I was doing**: 3 months ago, I've switched to body weight exercices (and kept squatting and deadlifting). It was so humbling to see I couldn't do any of the body weight exercices properly, even if I could lift more that 120kg... My body wasn't used to those exercices, and I had to start from the beginning. However, I'm seeing really great progress so far, and I'm really looking forward to see how far I can go. **Seeing those progress gives me even more excitements when I go to workout**.

If you're looking for a bodyweight program, you should have a look into one of these [beginners program](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/index#wiki_beginner_to_intermediate). I'll not talk more about this since I don't think 3 months is enough time into a program to give any thoughts on it, but I'll keep you posted!

**My takeaway about programs, is that there is no perfect programs. You should pick one that works for you, excites you, make you keep going to the gym. No matter what your gym bros says.**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Make working out a habit
Habits is key when you start working out. The main benefit is that you'll not need any [willpower](https://oliveremberton.com/2014/life-is-a-game-this-is-your-strategy-guide/) to go to the gym if it becomes an habit. 

I know don't really think when I need to workout. It come to a point when feel really bad (guilty?) if I don't go to the gym for more than 2 days. The challenge with travelling is to find a place where to workout and the financial part of it. So making those 2 parts easy (in a park and free) you'll just find no excuse to workout during your travel 

If everytime, it might mean you didn't change

Why 

## üë≠üë≠ Making friends

A great and indirect benefit of doing any sport (team sport more than lifting weight) is making **local** friends. As a temporary visitor, of any given city you can sometimes feels a bit lonely from time to time, or would like to have people to hang out with or showing you the city. 

An interesting example would be Japan, where, unlike what people tend to think, meeting new people isn't as easy as in other countries. The reason is the culture, and the notion of ["uchi-soto" (ÂÜÖ-Â§ñ)](http://www.ageekinjapan.com/uchi-soto-%E5%86%85-%E5%A4%96/) deeply impregneted in the japanese society, where anything/foreigners in the "outer" circle, isn't meant to be "friend". That's quite an interesting notion and something non-japanese has difficulty to understand, and there is many interpretation.

I've asked one of my friend Gab that worked in the aerospace industry in Japan for a year. and he told me Karate

I've myself went to these volleyball meetup, and the same night ending up drinking with new person!

I like going to play volleyball in Tokyo, and it's where I've met people I hang out with 


## üë©üèº‚Äç‚öïüè• A word of caution
Traveling can add more (sometimes legitime) excuses for not working out.  Traveling accross timezone cause jet lag and make you seek or tired. This is something you can't really control. After 4 years of traveling around the world, I'm still having issues about it. For my last trip from Okinawa (Japan) to Scottdsdale (Arizona), I didn't feel great for 2 full weeks. 

I don't recommend you to workout if you're feeling off. You'll be less cautious about your form and this can cause bad injuries. It happened to me twice already, one from a 2019 trip from Taipei To San Diego. I absolutely wanted to go to the gym because of some personal goals I've set, but I ended up injuring my lower back, and couldn't work out for almost 2 months. 

, I just go. But sometimes I'll find some excuses to not go, 

Obviously I sometimes skip a week or a month because of [insert any excuses]. 
I remember during where I played volleyball 2 times a week and kept working out. Results were not great at all, and made me really tired.
