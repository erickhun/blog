Hi there, thanks for cheking the blog! I'm Eric, engineer at [Buffer](https://buffer.com). I've been working remotely since 2013 now, from different places in the world. I happen to be mostly in Asia, my favorite part of the world!

I'm travelling quite a bit, I'd like share a little bit of the places I visit, my experiences, or challenges about remote work. I love food, some of my destinations are actually only about food 😅.

If you happen to read this and find my posts interesting, just [let me know](https://twitter.com/eric_khun)! Will be happy to have a chat with you around a coffee ☕️ (or red wine 🍷?).
