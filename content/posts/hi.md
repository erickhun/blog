Hi there, thanks for cheking the blog! I'm Eric, engineer at [Buffer](https://buffer.com). I've been working remotely since 2013 now, from different place in the world. I happen to be mostly in Asia, my favorite part of the world.

I'm travelling quite a bit, I'd like share a little bit of the place I'm visiting, my experiences, challenges about remote work.

If you happen to read this and find my post interesting, just [let me know](https://twitter.com/eric_khun)! Will be happy to have a chat with you around a coffee. I might certainly pass to in your country!
