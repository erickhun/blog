- Taiwan is Chill and relax

- Awesome people, polite and clean

- Best place in the world to work from cafes. Many cafes shops welcome people who works for long hours. They also care about cafe ;) I actually prefer to work from cafes than co-working here

- Surrounded by nature, mountain, sea, river are within 45minutes reach. Hundred of trails around Taipei.

- Metro / Bus system is top notch, no car needed, it's flat so you can bike everywhere easily. The bike sharing (uBike) is everywhere. I use it daily.

- People are genuinely kind, friendly, curious. Did I mentioned people 2 times? They deserve a 3rd mentioned, they really are.

- Visa is easy to get if you are employed (aka not freelancing), and earn more than usd5.5k/month, or work in a "trendy" field, you can get the ["gold card visa"](https://taiwangoldcard.com/) up to 3 years. It comes with a work visa, and not attached to any company! Is any other country has such a perk to attract talented people?

- Great healthcare (and the best best country that managed the coronavirus)

- LGBT friendly. [First asian country legalizing same-sex mariage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_Taiwan)

- Warm (but quite humid)

- Convenient , 24/7 convenience stores, within 2 minutes walk from everywhere, really often, 2 convenience stores face each other (no kidding)

- Awesome international food scene , you can find any western food , and local food is amazing. Japanese food is amazing, as good as in Japan, but cheaper (it's an old japanese colony, and the favorite destination of japanese people)

- It's a better China (I lived in China for 4 years)

Cons:

- It is so relax / chill that it somehow bugs me. I sometimes worry to become "soft", staying here bc it's too convenenient

- Wish the startup / tech scene was better

ps: if you live in Taipei hit me up :)
