An ex-classmate shared with me today the [Plum.io](http://plum.io/) test. My results are available [here](https://app.plum.io/profile/669371484c2877f475072a3dcab9a96dac2e244b).

The 3 "talents" that stands out were: 

- Conflict: Resolution: stay calm , empathie, being polite when you disagree
- Teamwork: be tactful, courteous of others,  be sensitive to others needs, support others, encourage positive interactions
- Communication:  "good long term relationships, even with difficult people", "built on tactful and considerate interactions", "Good at knowing the right thing to say to people and at understanding how people will accept what you are going to say to them", "soliciting and accepting feedback and criticism from others"

Sounds about right? :) 

Which personality test do you recommend me to do?
