DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is probably one of today's biggest opportunity to generate interest out of your own money. It unlocked the possibility to anyone to **become their own bank**, and to make the most of their money. DeFi allows their users to make all kind of various transactions, like exchanging currencies (via your bank that use the FOREX in the traditional financial system), lend, borrow. And with this, come the possibility to collect fees and interest.

As for today 31st December, the value transiting into Decentralized Finance has a value of 245 Billion dollars.

## Option 1: Lend your cryptocurrencies, and get interest
Banks makes money by taking the money you have deposited in their account and lend your money to other customers that ask for. Usually, this happen without you knowing it. That's usually how banks make the majority of their profit. If you're not making any interest from your cash account, your bank probably make (a lot of) money on the cash deposited, without you getting anything.  The profit made from those loans is categorized as"Net Interest Income", and for the Deutch Bank, represent more than 65% of their revenue in 2011:

In a DeFi world, you can deposit your cryptocurrencies in the lending services. The most knowns are [Aave](https://app.aave.com/markets) or [Compound](https://app.compound.finance/). The interest rate can change a lot, and really fast. It's not unusual to see lending interest rate over 20%, and often more. Those rates depends of many parameters, such demands, if there is any incentives, etc... On [DefiPulse](https://defipulse.com/defi-lending), you can see the rates of the various lending services on Ethereum.

Lending interest rates on Ethereum are also quite low, compared to some lending service from other blockchains. [Trader Joe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/lending) on Avalanche have higher interest rates, because they have [incentives](https://medium.com/avalancheavax/trader-joe-enters-avalanche-rush-with-an-incentives-program-up-to-20m-4646c6c20261) to attract users from other blockchains.

## Option 2: Become a Liquidity Provider, get the fees when there is a currency conversion

The most known way to buy cryotocurrencies is to go through services like Coinbase or Binance, that use order books to match buyers with sellers. They are called Centralized Exchanges, or CEX. CEX takes fees to help the transactions to happen. In the DeFi world, Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) allow users to swap crypto assets without an intermediary. The ones getting the fees are the one helping to "provide liquidity", also called Liquidity Providers (or LPs). And what is amazing is that everyone, like me or you, can become a Liquidity Provider and get the fees when someone make a conversion from X to Y.

Another way to see this is that instead of giving the fees to CEX (like Binance or Coinbase), or more traditionally to your bank, you're giving the fees to the ones helping to make this service work, and this could be you, me, or your neighbor.

Here an example of what are the fees distributed to Liquidity Providers, when I want to exchange (or "swap") some crypto currencies on a DEX, like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) or [Trader Joe](https://www.traderjoexyz.com/)

## Risks
When lending your cryptocurrencies or becoming a Liquidity Providers, you should be aware of the different layer on the various blockchains come with it risks. The risks of a traditional banking system exists, but you are usually covered with insurance and local laws in case of insolvency or wrongdoing, so even if they exist, they are limited.  In a blockchain world, those risks are different. You won't be covered if someone steal your money. 

### SmartContract Risks

When lending your cryptocurencies, you basically give them to a smartcontract where the rules are written. However, if there are flaws into the code, there is nothing we can do about it, and if someone finds out about the flaw, you'll likely lose the asset you've lent.  Cream Finance, a leading lending platform, one [has been victim of one of those hack](https://medium.com/@AndyPavia/swissblock-post-mortem-cream-finance-hack-7c1caff4335c). 

To prevent those risks if you can't read the smartcontract code. Ideally:
- The platform you are using has a clean track record. 
- They've asked profesionals to perform [audits](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract-audit) on their smartcontract code. 

### Blockchain risks
One of the most of the blockchain its decentralization property. In a traditional system, 1 authority could the autority to falsify a transactions as thei will. In a decentralized blockchain world, it shouldn't be possible, **in theory**.

Indeed, some blockchains aren't as "dencentralized" as they seem. If for some reasons, 1 bad actor has the ability to take control of the nodes validating the transactions because the network isn't decentralized enough, this bad actor could change/add/remove any  transaction as its will. Picking a blokchain where decentralisation is respected is important and give you more peace of mind. 

I'd be cautious to use blockchains such as [Polygon](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nfsger/polygon_matics_network_centralization_issue_top_3/), [Solana](https://cointelegraph.com/news/scalability-or-stability-solana-network-outages-show-work-still-needed) or [Binance Smart Chain](https://twitter.com/WilsonWithiam/status/1381420702918664194) where the nodes validating the transaction are just a few entitities having control on them. In contrary,the Ethereum or Avalanche blockchains do not have this decentralization issues.
