Google Maps is the application I use most in my daily life. Whether I want to go somewhere else in the city, need to know where the nearest subway station is, or am looking for a restaurant or a bar. One of the most useful features is probably user reviews. 

My first contributions were made 7 years ago, prompted by a rather innocent push notification from Google Maps: 'How was restaurant/hotel XX?' I would then add some photos with a tap, and my opinion was published. They followed up with some 'magic internet points' via emailâ€”lots of views with relatively low effort. I was hooked:

Because I like to see how my contributions impacted other people (I know, ego...), I noticed that Google Maps has slowly and silently added and experimented with social network features over the past few years. They've silently released many social features, including profiles where you can see other people's contributions. 

In the past few months, I've noticed a stronger push on their new social network features, with the application undergoing quite a few changes.


## Adding Social Graph: 

They've added the following features to the home screen:

- The "Latest" popip displays what has happened in the area you are checking.
- Reviews from people I've chosen to "follow."
- Reviews from a "Specialist" in a particular area or topic that might interest me. For instance, when I was exploring a mountain area, I came across a review from a "hiking specialist." (check the screenshot)
- If I haven't followed a profile, there's a button to follow that person.
- You can then scroll down to see many other reviews.

#### More aggressive push notifications
I've also started to receive more frequent push notifications on people following me, or my reviews reaching some sort of level of engagement:

#### Users profile

They provide users with profiles and have a suggestion tab where you can discover other users you might be interested in following. Your profile is assigned a URL (although you can't choose it yet), and you can share it publicly.

#### Lists:
Some users create curated list. They sometimes has public lists, I follow those list and they appears on my Google map application:

## Where is Google Maps heading?

<!-- When in Europe, I met local mnetionning multiple time : look what is good in Instagram. 

Google maps is propably a better place to look up for this information.


It is in my opinion a really smart way to do it. Experimenting silentely those early adopters who care and contribute instead of trying to forcing all their users. 
It's also really since the wide usage of Google Maps. I don't know anyone who does not use it today. 

After the failure of Google Plus.  -->

####  Some smart stuff they are doing:
- They have a separate website where they are trying to build a local community: https://www.localguidesconnect.com/. However, this connection is currently happening outside of Google Maps (as of today). I'm really curious about how they'll handle the community aspect.
- They have had a really slow release until recently. I believe they're tracking how well each feature is performing and using the Local Guide community to gauge their reactions to changes.
- Instagram and Facebook can turn into dating apps. I think the Google Maps team is trying to avoid that, with some details like not allowing users to "zoom in" on profile pictures.
- Contributions can be turned private.

<!-- ####  Improvements they could do -->
<!-- - Not everyone would want - The possibility ot opt-out for the social network features. 


Businesses fighting against fake reviews. Restaurants asking Good reviews in exchange of something.

Google maps It has huge impact in local businesses. When you see people outside a restaurant undecided to get inside the restaurant looking at their phone, they probably check the reviews on Google Maps. 

Having a low score will impact negatively. I do that only swear by this: any restaurant under 4 stars is a no go. 

What' also interesting is that those social features are only in mobile application, and not on web.


Buying followers , bots, advertising , not allowing links -->

Google is clearly pushing for the social aspect of Google Maps. Is it  becoming the social network that can actually be useful, or [will it be terminated](https://killedbygoogle.com/) like so many other products?
