It's 2025, and `/usr/local/bin` still not a directory in MacOS (15.1) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . Programs you download (via Homebrew or online) are usually set inside this folder. 

Here the correct way to create it: 

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin
```

Why `755`?. It follows the principle of least privilege while still allowing the necessary functionality - anyone can use the programs, but only root can modify them:

- Owner as `root` with `rwx` permissions is standard because the system (root) needs full control to manage executables
- Group as `wheel` with `r-x`, `wheel` is traditionally the admin group on Unix systems
- Others with `r-x` because:
  - Everyone needs to be able to read (`r`) and execute (`x`) programs in this directory
  - They shouldn't be able to write (`w`) to it, which prevents regular users from modifying system binaries

Hope this helps.
