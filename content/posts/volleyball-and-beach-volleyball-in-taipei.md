Taiwan is a great place if you like to play indoor and outdoor volleyball. You can usually use any outdoor high school or university court for free, and you'll usually find regular players. However, beach and grass aren't common at all.  I've got lucky to spend enough in Taiwan to play on beach, indoor and outdoor courts in Taiwan. I will share my findings,  hopefully this could save you some time!

## Beach-volley (and grass volleyball)

Funnily enough, most beaches in Taiwan do not have any decent beach volleyball. The only decent beach court with good net tension seems to be at [Bebin Park in Hualien](https://www.google.com/maps?cid=15490952783537478442), but it's too far from Taipei. One beach court exists in New Taipei City in the [Sunshine Sport Park](https://goo.gl/maps/BkCM96u4DDPafrocA), but the sand there isn‚Äôt great and the net is not maintained.

We've created a group and use a [nice Park & Sun portable volleyball net](https://www.parksun.com/Volleyball/Sets/spectrum-classic-volleyball-set.php) that we use every few weeks. We usually play 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 at a [BB to A level]({{<ref "#skill-level" >}}). Feel free to [reach me out](/about/) if you are interested (2x2 and 3x3 is quite intense, we require BB or + level).

Because of some regulations, we can't set our net everywhere. I had to do some research where we can set our portable net. I've compiled in this map places where you can play beach volleyball with an existing net (but don't expect much), and also locations where you can set a portable net. Some groups (in Kaoshuing and Keelung) also have their net. I've put their informations in [the map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rZCw3SdiIVBASaNPQgN9-O2cCEv9TVQ&hl=en&ll=23.580052342615545%2C121.05340829999996&z=8):

I've tried to ask Taipei City if it was possible to play in Daan Park (that would be awesome isn't it?), but received a negative response, even though they can play [basket ball](https://goo.gl/maps/hSfF91PNTJGXdNcNA) there ü§î. If anyone would know how to convince the city to let us play in parks, please let me know üôè

## Outdoor volleyball 

Universities and High schools allow outsiders to use their outdoor court for free. Many groups exist, but you'll have to speak Chinese to be able to communicate with your teammates. There is an English speaking [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/taipei-sports-and-social-club/) that gathers every weekend. The individual level can be anywhere from [B- to A level]({{<ref "#skill-level" >}}). I usually go to play there since the vibe is great! It can also become quite competitive.

## Indoor volleyball
In Taiwan, indoor courts usually aren‚Äôt free to use. It is expected to pay a fee and it‚Äôs shared among the players (usually NTD150 to NTD300 per player, depending on the location). It‚Äôs more competitive and I'd say the minimum required level is [BB or +]({{<ref "#skill-level" >}}).  You will need to know some players already playing indoor to access to them and chinese is usually required. 

This was one group I used to play with few years ago:

## And if I want to play with Taiwanese or in any other city?

When I travel and want to play, I usually post on this [Facebook Group - ÊéíÁêÉÂíñ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/186877438033868). If your Chinese isn't great, use Google Translate. I usually get lucky, and players usually welcome you! 

I did that recently when travelling to Kenting, and met really friendly and good great student players willing to come almost everyday:
