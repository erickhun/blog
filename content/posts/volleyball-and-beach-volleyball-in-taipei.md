Taiwan is a great place if you like to play volleyball. You can usually use any outdoor high school or university court for free, and you'll usually find regular players. However, beach and grass aren't common at all.  I've got lucky to spend enough in Taiwan to play on beach, indoor and outdoor courts in Taiwan. I will share my findings,  hopefully this could save you some time!

## Grass volleyball

One group is playing almost every Sunday (when weather allows). It has a nice and chill vibe (if you are quite serious, it might not be for you). Usually play 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 at B- to A- level. Drop a message in this <a href="https://line.me/ti/g2/Tf7es9b6SQoe5iPIEENyecU9XnCFEzSrNAxAEw"> Line Group</a> if you're interested.

## Beach volleyball

Unfortunately, most beaches in Taiwan do not have any decent beach volleyball courts. The only decent beach court with good net tension seems to be at [Bebin Park in Hualien](https://www.google.com/maps?cid=15490952783537478442), but it's too far from Taipei. One beach court exists in New Taipei City in the [Sunshine Sports Park](https://goo.gl/maps/BkCM96u4DDPafrocA), but the sand and net there aren‚Äôt great (careful your knees!). 

{{< youtube QPptJaJlCE4 >}}

We have a group with a [Park & Sun net](https://www.parksun.com/Volleyball/Sets/spectrum-classic-volleyball-set.php) that (try ) to play every few weeks during summer time. We usually play 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 at a [BB to A level]({{<ref "#volleyball-skill-level-in-taiwan" >}}).  Feel free to  <a href="https://line.me/ti/g2/Tf7es9b6SQoe5iPIEENyecU9XnCFEzSrNAxAEw">join this Line Group</a></li> if you are interested (2x2 and 3x3 is quite intense, we require BB or + level). 

<!-- ![Spectrum Classic Beach and Grass volleyball net](/img/volleyball-taipei/spectrum-classic-net-taiwan.jpg) -->

The challenge is to find location where we can set the net. Because of some regulations, we can't set the net everywhere. I had to do some research where we can set our portable net. So I've compiled in this map places where we can set our net, but also added location with existing beach court with a net  (but don't expect much from them). Some groups (in Kaoshuing and Keelung) also have their own nets. I've put their informations in [the map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rZCw3SdiIVBASaNPQgN9-O2cCEv9TVQ&hl=en&ll=23.580052342615545%2C121.05340829999996&z=8):

Here our group playing in Fulong Beach (we've setup the net):

And here when we played in Wanli beach (with an okay net). You'll have to pay 300TWD/head when you access to the [resort](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hh55aqFMzDScyWuC6)

<!-- 
I've tried to ask Taipei City if it was possible to play in Daan Park (that would be awesome isn't it?), but received a negative response, even though they can play [basket ball](https://goo.gl/maps/hSfF91PNTJGXdNcNA) there ü§î. If anyone would know how to convince the city to let us play in parks, please let me know üôè

## Outdoor volleyball 

The most surprising thing when I arrived in Taipei was to see all those middle / high shchools and universities having volleyball courts available to the public, and they are usually occupied! They allow outsiders to use their outdoor courts for free. You can join any group playing easily, and you will find any level plating. But you'll have to speak Chinese to be able to communicate with your them to be more "accepted". Here what look like the NTU courts (they have 6 outdoor courts!) around 6pm on a Sunday: 

![NTU volleyball courts Taipei](/img/volleyball-taipei/ntu-vball-courts.jpg)


For English speaker, there is a great [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/taipei-sports-and-social-club/) that gathers every weekend. The individual level can be anywhere from [B- to A- level]({{<ref "#volleyball-skill-level-in-taiwan" >}}). I usually go to play there since the vibe is great! It can also become quite competitive: 

![Outdoor meetup volleyball Taipei](/img/volleyball-taipei/outdoor-meetup.jpg)


## Indoor volleyball
In Taiwan, indoor courts aren‚Äôt free to use. It is expected to pay a fee and it‚Äôs shared among the players (usually NTD150 to NTD300 per player, depending on the location). It‚Äôs more competitive and I'd say the minimum required level is [BB or +]({{<ref "#volleyball-skill-level-in-taiwan" >}}). You will need to know some players already playing indoor to access to them and chinese is usually required.  [The ÊéíÁêÉÂíñ Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/186877438033868), recruits players when they need some, but it will be in chinese. 

This was one group I used to play with few years ago: 

{{< youtube helUuGkQYkA >}}

## And if I want to play with Taiwanese or in any other city?

When I travel and want to play, I usually post on this [Facebook Group - ÊéíÁêÉÂíñ](https://www.facebook.com/groups/186877438033868). If your Chinese isn't great, use Google Translate. I usually get lucky, and players usually welcome you! 

I did that recently when travelling to Kenting, and met really friendly and good great student players willing to come almost everyday:

## Volleyball Skill level in Taiwan

The best way to get a sense of someone's level is to see them the playing.
But how to ask them their level? When somone saying they're are good is not enough, and you often ends up with surprise when in the court. 

It is easier to directly refer to some specific level that describe abilities to do specific moves. 
In USA or Europe, we have AA to D level.  In Taiwan, most players start playing volleyball when they get into college. 
That's why their their level is named after which team they've played during that time:

- The best players are at the Ê†°Èöä (Xi√†o du√¨) level, meaning "School team". They got intense training (check how the national's team [famous Hung-Min and Hong-Jie twin brothers were trained](https://www.travel.taipei/en/news/details/7254)), and they are the ones that usually plays professionally later on.
- Then come the Á≥ªÈöä (X√¨ du√¨) level, meaning "Department team". It originally refers to the "department" of a given school (such as MBA, Engineering, Economic department). There is various level within it, the best "departments" compete agains other "departments" from other schools. It will depend on different departments whether they have a coach or not.

   Level USA/Europe | Equivalent&nbsp;Taiwan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description
---------------------|-------------------|----
AA |Áî≤ÁµÑÁêÉÈöä (Ji«é z«î qi√∫du√¨)| Competitive college, semi-pro, or elite club experience. Consistent jump serves, quick attacks, multiple hitting shots. Can effectively run complex offensive systems and defensive adjustments
A |Ê†°Èöä (Xi√†o du√¨)| Elite club/college level player that can run different offenses (6-2, 5-1), have a great understanding of all positions on the court and can execute all skills with accuracy and power. Can execute float/jump serves and attack with power and direction
A- | Âº∑Á≥ªÈöä (Qi√°ng x√¨ du√¨)| Strong Club. Solid competitive background.  jump serve, strong float serve control. Good passing form with 60-70% accuracy on serve receive. Can hit with power but shot selection/timing needs work
BB (High School Varsity)|Á≥ªÈöä (X√¨ du√¨)| Competitive High School. Can run basic offensive patterns and defensive formations. May have played in high school varsity and 7 out of 10 passes go to the person they intended. Understands offensive concepts (6-2, 5-1) and defensive positions but may be working to solidify those skills. 
B| Êñ∞Á≥ªÈöä (Xƒ´n x√¨ du√¨)| Can perform basic skills in practice but struggles in game situations. Understanding of positioning but execution breaks down in fast plays. Played in many organized leagues and skills have progressed well beyond beginner level, or have played some school team or club volleyball (BB level) but skills are rusty. Knows how to bump, set (a little), and spike.
B-|Á§æÂúòÈöä (Sh√® tu√°n du√¨)| Players can maintain rallies
C|Áè≠Èöä (BƒÅn du√¨)|A beginner to volleyball and attempts to pass, set and hit but doesn't always work out.
D| ‰ºëÈñíÁé©ÂÆ∂ (Xi≈´xi√°n w√°njiƒÅ)|"Recreational" player where goal is to always put the ball over on the other side of the net
