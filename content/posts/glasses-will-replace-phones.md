Apple, Google catching up ? 

Meta bet on AI
All the ai research is under reality labs through FAIR. Theyre spending billions on GPU buy alone. You can claim gen ai is a necessity for the metaverse but I do think its a bit misleading to say VR lost 4 billion this quarter when a huge amount of that went to an open source LLM

Meta criticize on the metaverse justified?

Google isn't willing to burn it 
Zuckerberg might be onto something. Willingness to burn cash to solve the problems of VR , and try to miniaturize it.
