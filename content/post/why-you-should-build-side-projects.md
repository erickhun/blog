title = "Why You Should Have Side Projects"
+++

I often advocate people surrounding me to build their own side projects. I believe they can fulfill you in so many ways, career wise, relationship wise, or even financially wise. [Buffer](https://buffer.com), the company I currently work for, was itself a [side project](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1956119).
I've myself built multiple side projects. The major ones being PartyInBeijing (sunsetted), Citymayor (live), Nodablock(sunsetted) and now [TravelHustlers](https://travelhustlers.co) and I strongly believe they bring me where I currently am now.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Working on something you are passionate about or care
For me, the main reason to start a side project is to create something you are **passionate**, **care** about, or you think you **can help other people with**.

My first side project, PartyInBeijing, was helping first people who had issue to go to venues. Since address in chinese were not the easiest ones to prununce, we've created with friends an App that prununciate the address of a venue (then added later on events and tickets sales).

An other one, Travel Hustlers, is one started because I travel frequently, and often in long layovers. it's been a to find what I can do during a long layovers. 

Side projects are the perfect way to do so.

## üí∏ Making money
One of the most positive and concrete output of a side project is money.s

- Nodablock: $2000 (4 sales at $500)
- Citymayor: 
- Party in Beijing: $2350 in ticket sales

Some people I know that are making $$
- [Jordan](https://twitter.com/JordanMorgan10) (iOS @ Buffer) launched successfully [SpendStack](https://apps.apple.com/app/spend-stack-smarter-lists/id1329068268)

I'm also often wondering if I had continue those projects how much I would have made today. 
Some people will think that a side project worth invest time if that makes money, but I don't think it should be the way to think about it. It ideally could become one, but it does not involve the same risks to take.

My current project ([Travel Hustlers](https://travelhustlers.co)) does not make any money (yet). Nodablock and Citymayor were money driven, Travel Hustlers and PartyInBeijing passion driven. The former being the one I've enjoyed to work the most, and I think fullfilled me the most. 

## ‚ú® A Security net, and a way to have your own business?
If for any reason you start. You could simply quit and focus. I wouldn't advise to quit your job to start a side project. I would . Check the small lines if there is not any clause making. That could also be.

- Maxime Berthelot built [PixelMe](https://pixelme.me) as a side project while working at Buffer
- [Paul McMahon](https://www.tokyodev.com) started (Doorkeeper](https://www.doorkeeper.jp) as a side while working in a Japanse company, and now fully focus on it
- [The Techlead](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xKdmAXFh4ACyhpiQ_3qBw) has his youtube channel. He [got fired](https://youtu.be/2pIJoPkh9IU) while working at Facebook, but still generates revenue from its channel. 


There is plenty of other examples. Just make sure with your employers (and contract) agree with you doing a side project.

## üìö Improving or building new skills

You might stay working for , the job is not as fulfilling as you wish, you are staying for financial / career reasons, or would like to simply than the scope of your company. 

Learning new skills that you don't usually need for your day to day job. It's a really great way to gett out of your comfort zone. 

I've forced mysef to write blog post to increase SEO. Learn how to negociate ticket prices we sell to my users. Learned how to say no. 
I've learned a lot about Ethereum and creating smart contracts buy building Citymayor and Nodablock. 

Going to conference and Talk to people

Party in Beijing was the project where I had to learn how to acquire new users in China, I've learnt the importance of retention, and how interacting with users is so important for a B2C app. I've remembered reading [Traction](https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer-ebook/dp/B00TY3ZOMS/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) that with actionnable examples you can easily replicate in any market, even China. 

There is no better way to learn a new technology by using it, better at sales by selling.




## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Finding a new job or opportunities  is easier
There is no better way to show you're able to code, do marketing or sales by doing building your own side project.  Writting about your side project is also a great things to increase the visibility of what you are building. You might fail to become successsul, but if you venture is public, recruiters or people who look will be able to find you or know what you tried to achieve. Tigran is doing it really well with [cronhub.io](https://blog.cronhub.io).


## üîé Knowing more about yourself , revealing what you dislike
It might be the only one B2B and money focused,  where I had to deal with people I didn't really appreciate. That kind of turned of off of people working on the industry. It also that money wasn't enough for me to pursue any project.


## üë≠üë´ Making new friends, meeting new people 
It's been 5 years I've been working remotely at Buffer. Isolation is often picked up as being the biggest issue. I've found a way was building often to make new friends I can hangout with. I remembered after spending, and I believe the side project played a big part of it.

One of the trap is to not have a focus on one.  to many. What I think is my case, I'm always wondering if I had . There is so many reasons to move on to an other project, or abandon
