Hi there, thanks for passing by! I'm Eric, engineer at [Buffer](https://buffer.com).

I remember writting a blog in French few years ago in high school. I'm not really sure what it was about, certainly about technology and me being intrigued about internet. For some reasons, I stopped writting, but always wanted to get back at it

So Why?

* I have the chance to work at [Buffer](https://buffer.com). I'd love to share some of my thoughts, challenges, or even fun I or we have. I'm sure there is a lot to say!
* I'm travelling quite a bit, I'd like share a little bit of the place I'm visiting
* The period we're living in is just mind blowing. So many new technolgies are invented everyday, IA, space travel, education, biotech etc... and so many to say about it

Let's see where it goes!
