+++

An ex-classmate asked me today to do a [Plum.io](http://plum.io/). I was expecting a coding code test, or full logic test. But it was mostly a soft skills test with a small part of logic.

My results are available [here](https://app.plum.io/profile/669371484c2877f475072a3dcab9a96dac2e244b). I'm a the top 5% to Conflict Resolution, Teamwork, and Communication. 

What's also interesting, is that I did the test a second time, and [got a lower score](https://app.plum.io/profile/6f0c9c37320cc2acf03187871ab5dd856fe9b826). I'm not totally sure why, I think I did different choices for the logic part, or maybe I wasn't as focus as the first time.
I think the different score also reflects how decision are made at different time of the day, and the context you're surronded at a given time.
