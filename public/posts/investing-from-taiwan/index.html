        <p>I&rsquo;ve been living in Taiwan for more than 3 years already. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time investigating on how to invest for my retirement from Taiwan. Fees and taxes has a huge impact on the Return of Investment if you invest on the long term.
Many expats  asked me the questions, so I&rsquo;ve decided to write down how do I do it , and also the different options you could consider</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t spend time on explaining why low fees, there is a lot of great resources   about it, but will mainly focus on specificity of Taiwan.</p>
<p>This article <strong>will likely apply to non-US citizen</strong>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not a financial advisor, and invite you to make more research. My recommendation could also not fit you. Please seek profesional advices.</p>
<h2 id="make-sure-to-have-an-emergency-fund-before-starting">Make sure to have an emergency fund before starting</h2>
<p>Do you have enough in your bank account for the next 6 months? This is the general recommendation. The is to never touch your investment until the next 15 to 20 years. The emergency fund will help you to give you enough buffer in you can lose your job, an accident  can happen without touching your long term investment.</p>
<p>I personally have my emergency fund in Revolut and Taipei Fubon Bank:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revolut: I&rsquo;m often abroad and the flexibilty that give you Revolut in any country is great.</li>
<li>Taipei Fubon Bank: I want keep a single bank, Taipei Fubon Bank is known for being the cheapest to send money abroad (I&rsquo;ll touch on this why this is important below )</li>
</ul>
<p>The downside of both is that you won&rsquo;t get much interest on them. Revolut doesn&rsquo;t have any interest, and Taiwan Fubon Bank rate are quite low (0.05%/week). Those aren&rsquo;t really profitable, but the goal is to have access to cash at time you won&rsquo;t expect, and it will help you and won&rsquo;t hurt your investment. Some europeans countries might also give you some better interest rates accounts, but check below if that suits you.</p>
<h2 id="which-financial-security-to-buy">Which financial security to buy?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll only focus here on a long term vision investment for the next 15 to 20 years. So if you&rsquo;re looking for short term returns, you&rsquo;re not in the correct place.</p>
<p>When buying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)">security</a> for the long term, you&rsquo;ll need to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being diversified</li>
<li>Have <strong>really low fees</strong></li>
<li>understand the <strong>tax consequences</strong> of owning them in Taiwan</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="diversification">Diversification</h4>
<p>I recommend an unsexy investment strategy of investing of globally diversified, split between equity and bonds based on your risk tolerance. The reason of it is to not put all your eggs in the same basket. Imagine putting all your saving in a single company and this company never grows, or worst goes bankrupt. This is called put all your egg in the same basket. There is some financial securities that help you to be diversified, they&rsquo;re called <a href="https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/indexinvesting/article-4596628/Does-matter-global-ETF-invest-in.html">ETFs</a> and buy purchasing a single share of it, it&rsquo;s like you own a part of up to thousands companies, in many countries.</p>
<p>I personally recommend <a href="https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251882/ishares-msci-world-ucits-etf-acc-fund">IWDA</a>. It has exposure to all developped countries (US, France, Japan, UK, Canada, etc&hellip;) and more than 1600 companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, in every sector, and the most developped countries. However, IWDA doesn&rsquo;t have exposure to those emergince market, I am biaisied having having lived in China and Taiwan. To be exposed to the best companies in those emerging countries, I recommend EIMI</p>
<p>Why so many countries and companies? The reason is simple&hellip; how do you know which country or company will perform better than others?
By investing in those 2 ETFs, you&rsquo;ll tap into the world&rsquo;s ability to grow. You can simply invest into the world&rsquo;s biggest companies by purchasing a single share of it.</p>
<!-- Even during , the ecoomy in the next years might be slower than the previous year. So you shouldn't expect high returns each year, and be prepared to also see some years with negative returns.

https://indexfundinvestor.eu/2019/01/02/what-is-the-difference-between-iwda-and-swda/


Even though , I still own some single stocks. They represent a really small part of my portfolio and I've mostly said "bye" to that money when I clicked "buy", enven though I hope they'll grow more than the ETFs. For them, I'm aware of them  -->
<!-- #### Reinvesting the dividends
IWDA also ticks the box. The difference of reinvesting and not reinvesting the dividends can determine if your investment will be exponential or not. 

- Accumulative vs Distributive. I like , so I don't need to think about re-investing the dividends back. The funds takes care of it for me. Also, you won't be able, until you have a full share. so you might miss some potential gains.  Please not that When the fund reinvest the dividends for you, it will hit the level 1 tax and the brokers fee.
- Index funds 


### How about Crypto-currencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum?

<h2 id="choice-of-a-broker">Choice of a broker</h2>
<p>Interaractive Broker will allow you to access to those ETFs from Taiwan. The process is straight forward. Simply fill your information and wait few days before validation</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also the cheapest way to invest in foreign ETFs from Taiwan. Local banks will charge you crazy fees to access to those foreign securities.</p>
<h3 id="make-sure-to-change-to-tier-pricing-instead-of-fix">Make sure to change to tier pricing instead of fix</h3>
<p>By default, the fixed pricing is set in Interactive brokers.
It only makes sense if your orders are over USD 8,000 (~228k TWD). If below, I recommend you to switch to the tier pricing. I&rsquo;ve saved hundred of USD by doing this simple change.</p>
<h3 id="send-money-to-interactive-brokers-from-taiwan">Send money to Interactive Brokers from Taiwan</h3>
<p>To be able to purchase ETFs on interactive brokers, you&rsquo;ll need to fund you account. Interactive Brokers will provide you a Citibank account to send you fund. Follow carefully the instructions Don&rsquo;t forget to indicate your reference number</p>
<p>If you receive salary in an US bank account, it&rsquo;s free and easy to send your USD to the Interactive Broker account.</p>
<p>If you receive money on a Taiwanese bank account, you&rsquo;ll need to do this . Taiwan Fubon Bank is the bank having the reputation to have the with the lowest fees to send money abroad. Simply shows up to the bank, and ask an employee to help you fill the document. Protip: Ask help to also link the Interactive Brokers account, so won&rsquo;t need to come again, and could make the wire transfer online.</p>
<h2 id="tax-in-taiwan">Tax in Taiwan</h2>
<h3 id="tax-on-capital-gain">Tax on capital gain</h3>
<p>The great benefit of Taiwan when investing that there is no capital gain. It means if you buy a stock that cost USD10 and sell it when it worth 100USD you won&rsquo;t pay tax on the USD 90 profit.</p>
<p>However, be careful, your brokers could  some fees when you sell. I&rsquo;ve heard some brokers that could take up to 5% on the gains. It&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to pick a broker.</p>
<h3 id="tax-on-dividends">Tax on dividends</h3>
<p>What is important to understand when calculating tax on dividends, is that it exists multiple levels of taxation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>L1TW</strong>: Percentage of tax withholding by a security&rsquo;s home country on dividends distributed by that security to the fund (Level 1).</li>
<li><strong>L2TW</strong>: Percentage of tax withholding by the country where the fund is domiciled on the dividends distributed to the investor by the fund (Level 2).</li>
<li><strong>L3T</strong>: Percentage of taxation that the individual investor needs to pay in their home country (Level 3).</li>
</ul>
<p>When investing in an world ETF composed mainly of US stocks, the fund domicile is important, especially if there is no treaty between your tax residence and the fund domicile. The US tax 30% flat on them. The trick here is to go through an Irish Fund. Luckily, IWDA is located in Ireland, so you can benefit from this tax treaty. Since IWDA is composed of 60% of US companies , there is a bit of math to do to exactly know how much tax will be taken .</p>
<p>When you friends say there is no tax on foreign income in Taiwan, they&rsquo;re talking on the <strong>L3T</strong> level. And this is applicable only if you&rsquo;re resident (living more than 183 days in Taiwan), otherwise you&rsquo;ll get a 21% flat on <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-taiwanhighlights-2020.pdf">those oversea dividends</a>. So be aware to stay at least 183 days in Taiwan to enjoy this benefit :)</p>
<p>If we purchased directly stocks from the US, dividends will be taxed 30% flat. This is because there is no tax treaty between Taiwan and the US.</p>
<p>Calculating the tax on the dividends for a given ETF is a bit tricky. Since an ETF contains share of many companies from different countried, you&rsquo;ll need to understand the composition of your ETF.  Since there is a treaty between the US and Ireland, and most companies being in the ETF are located in the US, the tax on the dividends are in average ~12%.</p>
<p>I had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/ewl5e8/is_it_possible_to_know_how_much_dividends_an/fg3aei4/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">to dig a bit</a> into how much yield the IWDA has, at the end of 2019, it is 1.0685/63.03 1.7% dividend yield.</p>

<h3 id="tax-on-crypto-currencies">Tax on crypto-currencies</h3>
<p>This is something that is still in discussion and I didn&rsquo;t have time to investigate in. If you have more information, feel free to reach me.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-fill-your-tax">How to fill your tax?</h3>
<p>Simply shows up to the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xReNBAMxigRMamSE6">tax office</a> during the tax season and declare your gain. You can easily generate a statement in Interactive brokers as a proof.</p>
