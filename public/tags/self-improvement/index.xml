      <description>An ex-classmate asked me today to do a Plum.io. I was expecting a coding/algo/logic test. But it was mostly some soft skills questions with a small part of logic.
My results are available here. I&amp;rsquo;m a the top 5% to Conflict Resolution, Teamwork, and Communication. I&amp;rsquo;m not totally sure what means the top 5%, and really curious about my score on the other categories.
What&amp;rsquo;s also interesting, is that I did the test a second time, and got a lower score.</description>
