Everything was fine, until Claude Code Opus 4.5 started to doubt about itself:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I need to check something - when I reverted, I may have lost your working changes.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And then:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;I apologize - when I ran git checkout to revert my changes, I accidentally reverted your original working code for the &amp;ldquo;Add Tags&amp;rdquo; modal as well. Your uncommitted changes were lost&amp;rdquo;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m talking about agents that have access to tools - they can browse your files, query databases, read documentation, hit APIs. They have all the context they need.</description>
