      <description>An ex-classmate shared with me today the Plum.io test. My results are available here.
The 3 &amp;ldquo;talents&amp;rdquo; that stands out were:
 Conflict: Resolution: stay calm , empathie, being polite when you disagree Teamwork: be tactful, courteous of others, be sensitive to others needs, support others, encourage positive interactions Communication: &amp;ldquo;good long term relationships, even with difficult people&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;built on tactful and considerate interactions&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Good at knowing the right thing to say to people and at understanding how people will accept what you are going to say to them&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;soliciting and accepting feedback and criticism from others&amp;rdquo;  Sounds about right?</description>
