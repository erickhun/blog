      <description>The world&amp;rsquo;s next innovations depends on a single country: Taiwan. It&amp;rsquo;s probably one country you might never heard about, or perhaps confuse with it neighbor, Thailand, or even think it&amp;rsquo;s a part of China.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Taiwan for 3+ years, and baffled that I never pay attention to semiconductors. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, but didn&amp;rsquo;t think much more about the importance of them. As far as my laptop can change code to real things and doesn&amp;rsquo;t lag when I have constantly hundred tabs open, I was satisfied.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a tremendous amount of time investigating on how to invest effectively from Taiwan. Many expats asked me the questions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down how do I do it. I&amp;rsquo;ll also write different options you could explore. This article will likely apply to Tax resident in Taiwan, non-US citizens. I&amp;rsquo;m also not a financial advisor, and invite you to make more researches, please seek professional advice.
Make sure to have an emergency fund before starting Do you have enough in your bank account for the next 6 months?</description>

      <description>YouBike (or Ubike) is my first choice of transportation when it comes to moving around the city of Taipei. I largely prefer it over taking the subway, bus, or taxi. It is affordable, well maintained, comfortable, at waking distance reach from anywhere, and the cities have built great biking paths in the major cities.
The number of YouBike rides keeps increasing steadily since it was launched in 2012. There were 170 million rides since it was introduced in 2012, and last month it reached ~3 million rides in Taipei:</description>
