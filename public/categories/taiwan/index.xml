      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reviewing hundreds of restaurants on Google Maps . I surprise myself with not knowing where to go to eat. Having too many choices isn&amp;rsquo;t always great isn&amp;rsquo;t it? I wanted to write down which restaurants that aren&amp;rsquo;t mainstream are worth going. Apart from the lonely planet, Michelin stars guides that will make places really busy with infinite lines, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a selection of more personal choices after trying hundreds of restaurant in Taipei.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a tremendous amount of time investigating on how to invest from Taiwan. Many expats asked me the questions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down how I do it. I&amp;rsquo;ll also write different alternative options you could explore. This article will likely apply to Tax resident in Taiwan, non-US citizens and talk about long term investment.
Remember: I&amp;rsquo;m not a financial advisor, and invite you to make more researches or seek professional advice.</description>

      <description>The world&amp;rsquo;s current and next innovations depend on a single country: Taiwan. It&amp;rsquo;s probably one country you might never hear about, or perhaps confuse with its neighbor, Thailand, or even think it&amp;rsquo;s a part of China.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Taiwan for 3+ years, and am baffled that I never pay attention to semiconductors. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer but didn&amp;rsquo;t think much more about the importance of them. As far as my laptop can change code to real things and doesn&amp;rsquo;t lag when I have constantly hundred tabs open, I was satisfied.</description>

      <description>YouBike (or Ubike) is my first choice of transportation when it comes to moving around the city of Taipei. I largely prefer it over taking the subway, bus, or taxi. It is affordable, well maintained, comfortable, at waking distance reach from anywhere, and the cities have built great biking paths in the major cities.
The number of YouBike rides keeps increasing steadily since it was launched in 2012. There were 170 million rides since it was introduced in 2012, and last month it reached ~3 million rides in Taipei:</description>
