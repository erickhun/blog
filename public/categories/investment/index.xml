      <description>“Hey Eric! Did you know you can make some “internet money” if you let this software run on your computer?” a workmate told me. I’ve assumed it could be a kind of spyware/adware showing me ads and didn’t consider the idea further. Few months later, in October 2016, An ex-classmate told me he made a good amount of money with that thing called “Ethereum”. I bought some Bitcoins and Ethereum after that via wechat.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a tremendous amount of time investigating on how to invest from Taiwan. Many expats asked me the questions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down how I do it. I&amp;rsquo;ll also write different alternative options you could explore. This article will likely apply to Tax resident in Taiwan, non-US citizens and talk about long term investment.
Remember: I&amp;rsquo;m not a financial advisor, and invite you to make more researches or seek professional advice.</description>
