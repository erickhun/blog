      <title>Create /usr/local/bin in macOS</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2025, and /usr/local/bin still not a directory in MacOS (15.1) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . Programs you download (via Homebrew or online) are usually set inside this folder.&#xA;Here the correct way to create it:&#xA;sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin Why 755?. It follows the principle of least privilege while still allowing the necessary functionality - anyone can use the programs, but only root can modify them:&#xA;Owner as root with rwx permissions is standard because the system (root) needs full control to manage executables Group as wheel with r-x, wheel is traditionally the admin group on Unix systems Others with r-x because: Everyone needs to be able to read (r) and execute (x) programs in this directory They shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to write (w) to it, which prevents regular users from modifying system binaries Hope this helps.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, there is no way to set up versions older than 5 previous versions with brew. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick workaround:&#xA;brew uninstall hugo Head to github.com/gohugoio/hugo/tags and navigate the version you need The Mac versions are the hugo_*_darwin-*.tar.gz ones darwin = macOS universal = works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs extended version includes additional features like SASS/SCSS support Download and extract the tar file Move the binary to /usr/local/bin When starting the Hugo binary for the first time, your Mac will show a security warning Don&amp;rsquo;t delete the binary Go to System Settings (or System Preferences) Privacy &amp;amp; Security Click &amp;ldquo;Install app anyway&amp;rdquo; Voila!</description>

      <description>Here the github repo for who want to fork my template and use it directly.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a seamless and efficient way to handle user authentication and management in your web applications, Nuxt3 and Firebase make this process incredibly easy. They both have lot of advantages:&#xA;Nuxt3 :&#xA;Allow you to have a frontend (and backend), easily deployable with 2 command line to execute (no joke!) Has a huge choices of modules available Coming from a a backend world, Nuxt is easy to use and understand and simply &amp;ldquo;make sense&amp;rdquo; Firebase and Firebase UI :</description>

      <description>How can you trust an individual, company, or government with the money you send to them? What tells you there are no hidden fees, or middleman in the contract you‚Äôre signing for? How do you make sure terms won‚Äôt be changed? Those are one of the exciting things I‚Äôm excited about smart contracts on public blockchains, the ‚ÄúCode is Law‚Äù feature (also called ‚Äúimmutability‚Äù). They are the promises of what a smart contract can fulfill.</description>

      <description>What is a blockchain? Why are some people using it? Even as a developer, it took me a few years to understand what a blockchain really is,how it is working from inside out. I&amp;rsquo;ll share here what I believe is a comprehensive explanation of what is a blockchain from a developer point of view.&#xA;What is a blockchain? In simple words, it‚Äôs a slow database.&#xA;For Bitcoin, this database contains a ledger only.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes: Make your services faster by removing CPU limits</title>

      <description>At Buffer, we&amp;rsquo;ve been using Kubernetes since 2016. We&amp;rsquo;ve been managing our k8s (kubernetes) cluster with kops, it has about 60 nodes (on AWS), and runs about 1500 containers. Our transition to a micro-service architecture has been full of trial and errors. Even after a few years running k8s, we are still learning its secrets. This post will talk about how something we thought was a good thing, but ended up to be not as great as we thought: CPU limits.</description>
