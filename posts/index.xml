      <description>I often advocate people surrounding me to build their own side projects. I believe they can fulfill you in so many ways: for your career, your relationships, or your independence. Buffer, the company I currently work for, was itself a side project.
I&amp;rsquo;ve built myself multiple side projects. The major ones being PartyInBeijing (inactive), Nodablock (inactive), Citymayor(need to fix), and now TravelHustlers. I believe each of them contributed and lead me to my current situation: being satisfied in my career, financially, and socially.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been flying between a lot between countries this past 4 years. Many people ask me how I keep exercising while moving between countries that often. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain here what I think helped me to keep that consistency.
For a bit of background, I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed playing volleyball since middle school, and try to go at least once a week, in any country I visited. It was already a habit I had since I was younger and I believe it helped me a lot.</description>

      <title>Fitness is the first step to greatness</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitness is the first step to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my favorite quote that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/justinkan&#34;&gt;Justin Kan&lt;/a&gt; keep saying in Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a quote I just start understand. I start working out 1 year ago. I can definitely relate this to work. and I find I can achieve more at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;have-clear-goals-to-challenge-yourself&#34;&gt;Have clear goals to challenge yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started, I tried to exercice every 2-3 days without any goals. Picking a workout machine randonly, and adding weight randomly. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t keep track of how heavy I could lift on each machine. I think at this time I just didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was doing. My motivation decreased a lot and I noticed that I went less often in the gym.
What is wrong with that? My motivation kept lowering week after week. I went to the gym less often, and started to find many excuse to not go. I start forgetting the benefits of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/234/765/b7e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;No idea what I&#39;m doing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://buffer.com&#34;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;rsquo;re lucky to have a slack channel called #improvements-fitness where bufferoos talk about their improvements and everything fitness related. I started to dig into the channel history and found a program that was quoted many times: &lt;a href=&#34;http://stronglifts.com&#34;&gt;Stronglift 5x5&lt;/a&gt; . After a quick look&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there, thanks for passing by! I&amp;rsquo;m Eric, engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://buffer.com&#34;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember writting a blog in French few years ago in high school. I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what it was about, certainly about technology and me being intrigued about internet. For some reasons, I stopped writting, but always wanted to get back at it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Why?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
