      <description>How can you trust an individual, company, or government with the money you send to them? What tells you there are no hidden fees, or middleman in the contract you’re signing for? How do you make sure terms won’t be changed? Those are one of the exciting things I’m excited about smart contracts on public blockchains, The “Code is Law” feature (also called “immutability”). They are the promises of what a smart contract can fulfill.</description>

      <description>What is a blockchain? Why are some people using it? Even as a developer, it took me a few years to understand what a blockchain really is,how it is working from inside out. I&amp;rsquo;ll share here what I believe is a comprehensive explanation of what is a blockchain from a developer point of view.
What is a blockchain? In simple words, it’s a slow database.
For Bitcoin, this database contains a ledger only.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a tremendous amount of time investigating on how to invest from Taiwan. Many expats asked me the questions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down how I do it. I&amp;rsquo;ll also write different alternative options you could explore. This article will likely apply to Tax resident in Taiwan, non-US citizens and talk about long term investment.
Remember: I&amp;rsquo;m not a financial advisor, and invite you to make more researches or seek professional advice.</description>

      <title>The world next innovations depend on a single country, Taiwan</title>

      <description>The world&amp;rsquo;s current and next innovations depend on a single country: Taiwan. It&amp;rsquo;s probably one country you might never hear about, or perhaps confuse with its neighbor, Thailand, or even think it&amp;rsquo;s a part of China.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Taiwan for 3+ years, and am baffled that I never pay attention to semiconductors. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer but didn&amp;rsquo;t think much more about the importance of them. As far as my laptop can change code to real things and doesn&amp;rsquo;t lag when I have constantly hundred tabs open, I was satisfied.</description>

      <title>Taiwan&#39;s amazing bike-sharing system</title>

      <description>YouBike (or Ubike) is my first choice of transportation when it comes to moving around the city of Taipei. I largely prefer it over taking the subway, bus, or taxi. It is affordable, well maintained, comfortable, at waking distance reach from anywhere, and the cities have built great biking paths in the major cities.
The number of YouBike rides keeps increasing steadily since it was launched in 2012. There were 170 million rides since it was introduced in 2012, and last month it reached ~3 million rides in Taipei:</description>

      <title>Kubernetes: Make your services faster by removing CPU limits</title>

      <description>At Buffer, we&amp;rsquo;ve been using Kubernetes since 2016. We&amp;rsquo;ve been managing our k8s (kubernetes) cluster with kops, it has about 60 nodes (on AWS), and runs about 1500 containers. Our transition to a micro-service architecture has been full of trial and errors. Even after a few years running k8s, we are still learning its secrets. This post will talk about how something we thought was a good thing, but ended up to be not as great as we thought: CPU limits.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;True innovation comes an intersection of a cross-pollination of roles and ideas&amp;rdquo; - Sunil, former-CTO@Buffer
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been working remotely at Buffer for 6 years now. As a software engineer, one of the critical skill I believe we should must have is being able to learn continuously. However, working in a fully distributed team, split accross 10+ timezones. I live in Asia (UTC +8) while most of my teammates live in the US or Europe.</description>

      <title>Making friends while travelling and working remotely</title>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t you feel alone when working alone? This might be questions that come the most.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working remotely at Buffer for 5 years now. I think I&amp;rsquo;d qualify myself as an &amp;ldquo;introvert&amp;rdquo;. I like spending time by myself. I&amp;rsquo;m actually doing it every time I&amp;rsquo;m going back to my parent&amp;rsquo;s place where not much happen , and without stepping much outside or seeing anyone else except my parent. However, there is sometimes that feeling of loneliness strikes all of sudden and when you&amp;rsquo;ll maybe want to meet.</description>

      <title>Why you should have a side project</title>
      <link>https://erickhun.com/posts/why-you-should-have-a-side-project/</link>

      <guid>https://erickhun.com/posts/why-you-should-have-a-side-project/</guid>
      <description>I often advocate people surrounding me to build their own side projects. I believe they can fulfill you in so many ways: for your career, your relationships, or your independence. Buffer, the company I currently work for, was itself a side project.
I&amp;rsquo;ve built myself multiple side projects. The major ones being PartyInBeijing (inactive), Nodablock (inactive), Citymayor(need to fix), and now TravelHustlers. I believe each of them contributed and lead me to my current situation: being satisfied in my career, financially, and socially.</description>

      <title>How to keep working out while traveling - 4 years in</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been flying between a lot between countries this past 4 years. Many people ask me how I keep exercising while moving between countries that often. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain here what I think helped me to keep that consistency.
For a bit of background, I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed playing volleyball since middle school, and try to go at least once a week, in any country I visited. It was already a habit I had since I was younger and I believe it helped me a lot.</description>

      <description>An ex-classmate shared with me today the Plum.io test. My results are available here.
The 3 &amp;ldquo;talents&amp;rdquo; that stands out were:
 Conflict: Resolution: stay calm , empathie, being polite when you disagree Teamwork: be tactful, courteous of others, be sensitive to others needs, support others, encourage positive interactions Communication: &amp;ldquo;good long term relationships, even with difficult people&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;built on tactful and considerate interactions&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Good at knowing the right thing to say to people and at understanding how people will accept what you are going to say to them&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;soliciting and accepting feedback and criticism from others&amp;rdquo;  Sounds about right?</description>

      <title>Fitness is the first step to greatness</title>
      <link>https://erickhun.com/posts/fitness-is-the-first-step-to-greatness/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitness is the first step to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my favorite quote that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/justinkan&#34;&gt;Justin Kan&lt;/a&gt; keep saying in Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a quote I just start understand. I start working out 1 year ago. I can definitely relate this to work. and I find I can achieve more at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;have-clear-goals-to-challenge-yourself&#34;&gt;Have clear goals to challenge yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started, I tried to exercice every 2-3 days without any goals. Picking a workout machine randonly, and adding weight randomly. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t keep track of how heavy I could lift on each machine. I think at this time I just didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I was doing. My motivation decreased a lot and I noticed that I went less often in the gym.
What is wrong with that? My motivation kept lowering week after week. I went to the gym less often, and started to find many excuse to not go. I start forgetting the benefits of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/234/765/b7e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;No idea what I&amp;rsquo;m doing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://buffer.com&#34;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;rsquo;re lucky to have a slack channel called #improvements-fitness where bufferoos talk about their improvements and everything fitness related. I started to dig into the channel history and found a program that was quoted many times: &lt;a href=&#34;http://stronglifts.com&#34;&gt;Stronglift 5x5&lt;/a&gt; . After a quick look&lt;/p&gt;</description>
