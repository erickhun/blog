      <description>ðŸ’¡ I wrote (750+) restaurants reviews on Google Maps - Follow me if you live in Taiwan I post food restaurants I like on Instagram If you visit Taipei, here my restaurants recommendation list for travelers I&amp;rsquo;ve been reviewing hundreds of restaurants on Google Maps (and now on Insagram) I surprise myself with not knowing where to go to eat. Having too many choices isn&amp;rsquo;t always great isn&amp;rsquo;t it? I wanted to write down which restaurants that aren&amp;rsquo;t mainstream are worth going.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a tremendous amount of time investigating on how to invest from Taiwan. Many expats asked me the questions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down how I do it. I&amp;rsquo;ll also write different alternative options you could explore. This article will likely apply to Tax resident in Taiwan, non-US citizens and talk about long term investment (15+ years horizon).
Remember: I&amp;rsquo;m not a financial advisor, and invite you to make more researches or seek professional advice.</description>

      <description>The world&amp;rsquo;s current and next innovations depend on a single country: Taiwan. It&amp;rsquo;s probably one country you might never hear about, or perhaps confuse with its neighbor, Thailand, or even think it&amp;rsquo;s a part of China.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Taiwan for 3+ years, and am baffled that I never pay attention to semiconductors. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer but didn&amp;rsquo;t think much more about the importance of them. As far as my laptop can change code to real things and doesn&amp;rsquo;t lag when I have constantly hundred tabs open, I was satisfied.</description>

      <description>YouBike is my first choice of transportation when it comes to moving around the city of Taipei. I largely prefer it over taking the subway, bus, or taxi. It is affordable, well maintained, comfortable, lightweight, and especially, at waking distance reach from anywhere.
The number of YouBike rides keeps increasing since it was launched in 2012. As for May 2024, there was 818 millions rides on youbike! The city with the the most rides is Taipei, with 46 millions rides in 2023:</description>
