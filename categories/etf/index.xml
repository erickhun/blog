      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a tremendous amount of time investigating on how to invest effectively from Taiwan. Many expats asked me the questions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down how do I do it. I&amp;rsquo;ll also write different options you could explore. This article will likely apply to Tax resident in Taiwan, non-US citizens. I&amp;rsquo;m also not a financial advisor, and invite you to make more researches, please seek professional advice.
Make sure to have an emergency fund before starting Do you have enough in your bank account for the next 6 months?</description>
