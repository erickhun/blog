      <description>DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is probably one of today&amp;rsquo;s biggest opportunities to generate high yield interest. It also unlocked the possibility for anyone to become their own bank. DeFi allows its users to make all kinds of various transactions, like exchanging currencies (via your bank that uses the FOREX in the traditional financial system), lending or borrowing. And with this capabilities, comes the possibility to collect fees and interest from those financial actions.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a tremendous amount of time investigating on how to invest from Taiwan. Many expats asked me the questions, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down how I do it. I&amp;rsquo;ll also write different alternative options you could explore. This article will likely apply to Tax resident in Taiwan, non-US citizens and talk about long term investment (15+ years horizon).
Remember: I&amp;rsquo;m not a financial advisor, and invite you to make more researches or seek professional advice.</description>
