      <description>The world&amp;rsquo;s next innovations depends on a single country: Taiwan. It&amp;rsquo;s probably one country you might never heard about, or perhaps confuse with it neighbor, Thailand, or even think it&amp;rsquo;s a part of China.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Taiwan for 3+ years, and baffled that I never pay attention to semiconductors. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer, but didn&amp;rsquo;t think much more about the importance of them. As far as my laptop can change code to real things and doesn&amp;rsquo;t lag when I have constantly hundred tabs open, I was satisfied.</description>
